# TheNathanDrake Node Template

## Description

This is a template for a Node.js project. It includes a basic Express server, and my preferred configuration for ESLint, Prettier, and Husky.

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.12.0 - LTS)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) (v1.22.19)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`.

### Usage

1. Run `yarn test` to verify that setup went smoothly.
2. Run `yarn dev` or `yarn devstart` to start the application.
